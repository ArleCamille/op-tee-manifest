# Repo manifest for Secure OpenCL
This git contains repo manifests for supporting secure OpenCL under TrustZone,
based on OP-TEE on ARM.

Currently, only the LeMaker HiKey960 development board is supported. Other
devices' contents are unchanged from vanilla OP-TEE for now.

All official OP-TEE documentation has moved to http://optee.readthedocs.io. The
information that used to be here in this git can be found under [manifests].
