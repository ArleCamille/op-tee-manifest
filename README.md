# Repo manifest for OP-TEE development

In the OP-TEE project we try to gather all documentation under the
[optee_os](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os) git, therefore we recommend that
you read the instructions at
[this](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/README.md) page which
describes how to setup OP-TEE on various platforms.
